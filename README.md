# Company Management Full Stack Application

### This project was a React/Java full stack group assignment during my training at Cook Systems Fast Track Program.
For this assignment, we were tasked with developing a full-stack company management application in React and Java with Spring Boot utilizing PostgreSQL for the database. The application is a project management tool that helps administrators distribute information, specifically announcements and project details, to their worker base. The application has two separate views conditional on the user's role permissions: Administrator view and Worker View. To create the tool, we split our team into 2 groups, backend and frontend, to handle the multitude of tasks and requirements involved in the application's creation. I was on the frontend team.

* Front-End
  - The Front End team was tasked with creating the visual aspect and user experience of the application based off the received wire-frame. By Connecting to the backend database we have the ability to access user specific data on Each page of the application. We implemented a series of pages and UI components with forms embedded.

* Back-End
  - The backend team was tasked with handling data access and information storage.  We created an API, which is an interface that allows application designers to easily interact with the data, and a database to store company, user, announcement, team, and project information.

### Login Page
